Hi everyone probably no one
so this is my first bit of code im making with some help from
im quite new and thought the first bit of code should be easy

How it works
1. open the Valuta omregnger.ink
it will ask you for an amount (this being the amount you want to exchange)

2:it will ask you from currency, add the currency you would like to exhange from

3. it will ask you To corrency, quite simple add the currency you want to exchange to

now i only have 21 diffrent currencies in my code so its a bit limited but you get the jist. i will add all avaible currencies in my readme.
do be aware this code is not fetching exchange rates as it running but using the exchange rates i inputed at time of creation 
Have fun
